# Sudoku Solver and Visualizer

Sudoku Solver Visualizer is an interactive web application that combines the power of algorithms and visualizations to solve Sudoku puzzles dynamically. Designed for both beginners and enthusiasts, this project not only solves puzzles but also offers insights into the solving process using a backtracking algorithm.


## Live Demo
- Deployed page -> https://atheeq2003.github.io/Sudoku-Solver/

## Overview

#### Interactive Sudoku Board:

- Input your puzzle directly or select a preloaded puzzle from the dropdown.
- Reset or clear the board anytime to start fresh.

#### Solver Visualizer:

- Watch as the Sudoku is solved step-by-step using recursive backtracking.
- Learn how logical algorithms approach complex puzzles.

#### Manual Play Option:

- Test your skills by solving the puzzle manually.
- Use interactive features to assist with tricky moves.

#### Custom Speed Control
- Adjust visualization speed (in milliseconds) for a tailored experience.

#### Preset Boards
- Includes easy, intermediate, and difficult puzzles.

#### Learn Sudoku Concepts:

- Understand the logic behind Sudoku as you interact with the solver.
- Visualize how backtracking efficiently tackles even the toughest puzzles.

## How to Use 
1. Select a puzzle from the dropdown or input your own custom board.
2. Click the Instant solve button to find the solution instantly.
3. Use the Solve button to see the algorithm in action.
4. Quickly reset the board for a fresh start using the Clear or Reset options.
